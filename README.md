# TeslaClone
This is a hybrid mobile application built using React Native/Expo, Google Firebase, React Navigation and UIKitten. React Native/Expo is used for building the front end, while Firebase is used for data management and storage. React Navigation is for enabling navigation across the different screens, while UIKitten is used for rendering the components in each screen.
